# R-TYPE

This Advanced C++ knowledge unit project enables the development of networked video games and provides an opportunity to explore advanced development techniques and learn good software engineering practices. The aim is to implement a multithreaded server and a graphical client for a well-known existing video game called R-Type, using a game engine of your own design.
